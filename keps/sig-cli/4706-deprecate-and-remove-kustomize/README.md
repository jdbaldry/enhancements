## Summary

Deprecate and remove kustomize from kubectl. This will allow both tools to
be developed and maintained separately.

## Motivation

Kustomize was [brought into kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70875)
shortly after its [initial release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/commit/e57010bcf641738738591eb48b4977843a494893).
The main motivation back then was to expand declarative support for kubernetes objects.
Over the past decade of kubernetes existence multiple, various tools for customization
and templating has been development. Given that, current kubectl maintainers
feel that promoting one tool over the other should not be the role of the project.

Moreover, decoupling both projects will allow them to move at separate pace. The
current kubernetes release cycle doesn't match that of kustomize, oftentimes
risking users of kubectl to work with outdated version of kustomize.

Lastly, some of the kustomize dependencies has already been problematic to the
core kubernetes project, so removing kustomize will allow us to minimize the
dependency graph and the size of kubectl binary.


### Goals

* Deprecate and remove kustomize from kubectl.

### Non-Goals

* Change kubectl or kustomize functionality.
* Change kubectl or kustomize release cycle.

## Proposal

Following the [official kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/#deprecating-a-flag-or-cli)
it is required to keep a generally available element of user-facing component to
be available at minimum 12 months or 2 releases. We're proposing to proceed with
the deprecation and removal of kustomize in the following stages:

1. v1.31 (alpha) - announce the deprecation of `kubectl kustomize` subcommand,
   `--kustomize` flag from all the subcommands using it, and from `kubectl version`
   output.
2. v1.31 - v1.33 - gather feedback from users, and publish kustomize in [krew index](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew-index).
3. v1.34 - v1.35 (beta) - disable kustomize by default from kubectl.
4. Entirely remove kustomize in v1.36 (planned as first release of 2026).

### Risks and Mitigations

#### Users relying on `kubectl kustomize`

There may be a significant group of users relying on the built-in kustomize.
Those users should switch to using [kubectl plugins](../2379-kubectl-plugins/README.md),
which allows kubectl users to invoke any `kubectl-*` prefixed binary as a native
kubectl command. Additionally, we will publish kustomize in [krew index](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew-index),
which provides a central repository for kubectl plugins.

#### Users relying on `--kustomize` flag

There may be a significant group of users relying on the built-in kustomize
inside one of the subcommands. Those users will be advised to use `kustomize build`
and pipe the output to appropriate command instead, as part of the deprecation warning.

## Design Details

In version 1.31 of kubectl we will implement warnings, such that all users of
`kubectl kustomize` will be informed that the subcommand is deprecated and they
will be directed to use standalone kustomize, or switch to kustomize plugin.
Users of `--kustomize` flag will be informed that the flag is deprecated,
and will be directed to use standalone kustomize.

The above warnings will be implemented behind a `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` environment
variable which starting from v1.31 will be on by default. Users interested in
trying out kubectl without kustomize will be able to disable the aforementioned
environment variable.

In version 1.34 we will disable the environment variable, disabling access to kustomize
by default in kubectl. At this point in time users will still have the option to
enable this mechanism back using `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE`.

In version 1.36 lock `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` to off by default, but leaving
the kustomize code base in kubectl for one more release.

Finally, in version 1.37 entirely drop kustomize from kubectl.

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

- `k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/genericclioptions`: `2024-06-10` - `22.5%`
- `k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/resource`:          `2024-06-10` - `71.8%`
- `k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/cmd/delete`:            `2024-06-10` - `77.6%`
- `k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/cmd/kustomize`:         `2024-06-10` - `0%`

##### Integration tests

- `run_kubectl_version_tests`:                        https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#pull-kubernetes-integration-go-canary
- `run_kubectl_apply_tests`:                          https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#pull-kubernetes-integration-go-canary
- `run_kubectl_create_kustomization_directory_tests`: https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#pull-kubernetes-integration-go-canary

##### e2e tests

None available.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Warning users that kustomize subcommand and flag is deprecated.
- Feature implemented behind an environment variable `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` turned on by default.
- Gather feedback from users

#### Beta

- Turn `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` environment variable off by default.
- Publish kustomize in [krew index](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew-index).
- Gather feedback from users

#### GA

- Lock `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` environment variable to off by default.

#### Deprecation

- Remove kustomize from kubectl code base.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Initially users will have the ability to test kubectl with and without kustomize
setting `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` to on or off. Eventually, once the functionality
is removed users will have the option to switch to kustomize plugin (preferred),
or stick with older version of kubectl as long as the support window allows.

### Version Skew Strategy

kubectl supports +/- one version skew. The deprecation and later removal
of kustomize will not affect the provided support window.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

Users will have an option to test kubectl with and without kustomize by setting
`KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` environment variable. Initially, by default this option
will be on.

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [X] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
    `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` environment variable
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
    No.
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?
    No.

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

Disabling `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` will remove access to `kubectl kustomize`,
`--kustomize` flag from appropriate subcommands and from `kubectl version` output.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, users will have `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` environment variable to do just that.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Enabling `KUBECTL_LEGACY_KUSTOMIZE` will keep access to `kubectl kustomize`,
`--kustomize` in the appropriate subcommands and in the `kubectl version` output.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

We plan to add integration tests (in `test/cmd`) exercising the functionality
with the environment variable turn on and off.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

N/A

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

N/A

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

N/A

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

We are deprecating `kubectl kustomize` subcommand, `--kustomize` flag from
appropriate subcommands, and from `kubectl version` output.

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

This is client-side functionality, so it is not affected by API server and/or etcd availability.

###### What are other known failure modes?

N/A

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

### Help with kustomize maintenance

[Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/) is pretty significant,
the project has been around for [6 years now](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/commit/e57010bcf641738738591eb48b4977843a494893).
Unfortunately, in the recent years the maintainers turnaround has been pretty
significant. Currently, the project is being overlooked by two primary contributors:
[Yugo](https://github.com/koba1t) and [Varsha](https://github.com/varshaprasad96).


### Minimize kustomize dependencies

The project over the years built a lot of functionality current users rely on.
The option to drop some of that, to be able to limit the scope of the dependencies
is thus limited by which functionality can be dropped. Further more, our goal is
not to limit the further development of kustomize, but only decoupling it from
kubectl.
