  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

The sleep action for the PreStop container lifecycle hook was introduced in KEP 3960. It however doesn’t accept zero as a valid value for the sleep duration seconds. This KEP aims to add support for setting a value of zero with the sleep action of the PreStop hook.

## Motivation

Currently, trying to create a container with a PreStop lifecycle hook with sleep of 0 seconds will throw a validation error like so:

```
Invalid value: 0: must be greater than 0 and less than terminationGracePeriodSeconds (30)
```

The Sleep action is implemented with the time package from Go’s standard library. The `time.After()` which is used to implement the sleep permits a zero sleep duration. A negative or a zero sleep duration will cause the function to return immediately and function like a no-op.

The implementation in KEP 3960 supports only non-zero values for the sleep duration. It is semantically correct to support a zero value for this field since time.After() also supports zero and negative durations. Negative values as well as zero have the same effect with time.After(), they both return immediately. We don’t need to support negative values since they have the same effect as setting the duration to zero.

A potential use case for this behaviour is when you need a PreStop hook to be defined for the validation of your resource, but don't really need to sleep as part of the PreStop hook. An example of this is described by a user [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3960#issuecomment-2208556397) in the parent KEP. They add a PreStop sleep hook in via an admission webhoook by default if the PreStop is hook is not specified by the user. In order to opt-out from this, a no-op PreStop hook with a duration of zero seconds can be used.

### Goals

- Update the validation for the Sleep action to allow zero as a valid sleep duration.
- Allow users to set a zero value for the sleep action in PreStop hooks to do a no-op.

### Non-Goals

- This KEP does not support adding negative values for the sleep duration.
- This KEP does not aim to provide a way to pause or delay pod termination indefinitely.

## Proposal

Introduce a `PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero` feature gate which is disabled by default. When the feature gate is enabled, the `validateSleepAction` method would allow values greater than or equal to zero as a valid sleep duration.

Since this update to the validation allows previously invalid values, care must be taken to support cluster downgrades safely. To accomplish this, the validation will distinguish between new resources and updates to existing resources:

- When the feature gate is disabled:
  - (a) New resources will no longer allow setting zero as the sleep duration second for the PreStop hook. (no change to current validation)
  - (b) Existing resources cannot be updated to have a sleep duration of zero seconds
  - (c) Existing resources with a PreStop sleep duration set to zero will continue to run and use a sleep duration of zero seconds. These can be updated and the zero sleep duration would continue to work.
- When the feature gate is enabled:
  - (c) New resources allow zero as a valid sleep duration.
  - (d) Updates to existing resources will allow zero as a valid sleep duration.

The proposed change adds another layer to the `validateSleepAction` function to allow zero as a valid sleep duration setting like shown:

```diff
-func validateSleepAction(sleep *core.SleepAction, gracePeriod *int64, fldPath *field.Path) field.ErrorList {
+func validateSleepAction(sleep *core.SleepAction, gracePeriod *int64, fldPath *field.Path, opts PodValidationOptions) field.ErrorList {
	allErrors := field.ErrorList{}
	// We allow gracePeriod to be nil here because the pod in which this SleepAction
	// is defined might have an invalid grace period defined, and we don't want to
	// flag another error here when the real problem will already be flagged.
-	if gracePeriod != nil && sleep.Seconds <= 0 || sleep.Seconds > *gracePeriod {
-		invalidStr := fmt.Sprintf("must be greater than 0 and less than terminationGracePeriodSeconds (%d)", *gracePeriod)
-		allErrors = append(allErrors, field.Invalid(fldPath, sleep.Seconds, invalidStr))
+	if opts.AllowPodLifecycleSleepActionZeroValue {
+		if gracePeriod != nil && sleep.Seconds < 0 || sleep.Seconds > *gracePeriod {
+			invalidStr := fmt.Sprintf("must be non-negative and less than terminationGracePeriodSeconds (%d)", *gracePeriod)
+			allErrors = append(allErrors, field.Invalid(fldPath, sleep.Seconds, invalidStr))
+		}
+	} else {
+		if gracePeriod != nil && sleep.Seconds <= 0 || sleep.Seconds > *gracePeriod {
+			invalidStr := fmt.Sprintf("must be greater than 0 and less than terminationGracePeriodSeconds (%d). Please enable PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero feature gate if you need a sleep of zero duration.", *gracePeriod)
+			allErrors = append(allErrors, field.Invalid(fldPath, sleep.Seconds, invalidStr))
+		}
	}
	return allErrors
}
```

Currently, the kubelet accepts `0` as a valid duration. There is no validation done at the kubelet level. All the validation for the duration itself is done at the kube-apiserver. The [runSleepHandler](https://github.com/AxeZhan/kubernetes/blob/3a96afdfefdf329c637623ae31a61d20dbdb0393/pkg/kubelet/lifecycle/handlers.go#L129-L141) in the kubelet uses the `time.After()` function from the [time](https://pkg.go.dev/time) package, which supports a `0` duration input. `time.After` also accepts negative values which are also returned immediately similar to zero. We don't support negative values however.

See the entire code changes in the WIP PR: [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127094](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127094)

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As a Kubernetes user, I want to to be able to have a PreStop hook defined in my spec without needing to sleep during the execution of the PreStop hook. This no-op behaviour can be used for validation purposes with admission webhooks ([Reference](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3960#issuecomment-2208556397)).

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

The change is opt-in, since it requires configuring a PreStop hook with sleep action of 0 second duration. So there is no risk beyond the upgrade/downgrade risks which are addressed in the Proposal section.

## Design Details

Refer to the Proposal section.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

Alpha:

- Test that the runSleepHandler function returns immediately when given a duration of zero.
- Test that the validation succeeds when given a zero duration with the feature gate enabled.
- Test that the validation fails when given a zero duration with the feature gate disabled.
- Test that the validation returns the appropriate error messages when given an invalid duration value (e.g., a negative value) with the feature gate disabled and enabled.
- Unit tests for testing the disabling of the feature gate after it was enabled and the feature was used.

Current coverages:

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/core/validation` : 2024-09-20 - 84.3
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/lifecycle/handlers` : 2024-09-20 - 86.4

##### Integration tests

<!--
Integration tests are contained in k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration.
Integration tests allow control of the configuration parameters used to start the binaries under test.
This is different from e2e tests which do not allow configuration of parameters.
Doing this allows testing non-default options and multiple different and potentially conflicting command line options.
-->

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:

-->

Basic functionality

- Create a simple pod with a container that runs a long-running process.
- Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with a sleep duration of `0`.
- Delete the pod and observe the time it takes for the container to terminate.
- Verify that the container terminates immediately without sleeping.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha
- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial unit/e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta
- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Additional e2e tests are completed (if needed)
- No trouble reports from alpha release

#### GA
- No trouble reports with the beta release, plus some anecdotal evidence of it being used successfully.


### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

#### Upgrade

The previous PreStop Sleep Action behavior will not be broken. Users can continue to use their hooks as it is. To use this enhancement, users need to enable the feature gate, and set the sleep duration as zero in their prestop hook’s sleep action.

#### Downgrade

If the kube-apiserver is downgraded to a version where the feature gate is not supported (<v1.32), no new resources can be created with a PreStop sleep duration of zero seconds. Existing resources created with a sleep duration of zero will continue to function.

If the feature gate is turned off after being enabled, no new resources can be created with PreStop sleep duration of zero seconds. Existing resources will continue to run and use a sleep duration of zero seconds. These resources can be updated and the zero sleep duration would continue to work.

### Version Skew Strategy

Only the kube-apiserver will need to enable the feature gate for the full featureset to be present. This is because the implementation is already handled in the parent [KEP #3960](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3960). The change introduced in this KEP is only to how the validation is done. If the feature gate is disabled, the feature will not be available. The feature gate does not apply to the kubelet logic since the time.After function used by the original KEP already supports zero as a valid duration.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-apiserver
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

The feature can be disabled in Alpha and Beta versions by restarting kube-apiserver with the feature-gate off. In terms of Stable versions, users can choose to opt-out by not setting the sleep field.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

New pods with sleep action in prestop sleep duration of zero seconds can be created.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

For the parent KEP, unit tests for the `switch` of the feature gate were added in `pkg/registry/core/pod/strategy_test`. We can add similar tests for the new feature gate as well.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

The change is opt-in, it doesn't impact already running workloads.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

I believe we don't need a metric here since the [parent KEP already has a metric](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3960-pod-lifecycle-sleep-action#what-specific-metrics-should-inform-a-rollback) to inform rollbacks. This KEP only updates the validation to allow zero value.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

This is an opt-in feature, and it does not change any default behavior. I manually tested enabling and disabling this feature by changing the kube-api-server config and restarting them in a kind cluster. The details of the expected behavior are described in the Proposal and Upgrade/Downgrade sections.


The manual test steps are as following:
1. Create a local 1.32 k8s cluster with kind, and create a test-pod in that cluster.
2. Enable PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero feature in the kube-apiserver and restart it.
3. Add a prestop hook with sleep action with duration of zero seconds to the test-pod and delete it. Observe the time cost.
4. Create another pod with sleep action duration of zero seconds.
5. Disable PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero feature in the kube-api-server and restart it.
6. Delete the pod created in step 4, and observe the time cost.


###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design

- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

N/A

## Alternatives

Another way to run zero duration sleep in a container is to use the exec command in preStop hook like so `["/bin/sh","-c","sleep 0"]`. This requires a sleep binary in the image. Since the sleep action already exists as a PreStop hook, it is easier to allow a duration of zero seconds for the sleep action.
