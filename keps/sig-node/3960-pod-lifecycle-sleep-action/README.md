## Summary

This KEP proposes the addition of a new sleep action for the PreStop lifecycle hook in Kubernetes, allowing containers to pause for a specified duration before termination. This enhancement aims to provide a more straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns and improve the overall lifecycle management of containers, and to handle new connections from clients that have not yet finished endpoint termination during the pod termination.

An example:

To use this feature to achieve zero downtime for nginx, we need to deploy a deployment with sleep prestop hook and a service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16.1
        lifecycle:
          preStop:
            sleep:
              seconds: 5
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

- Restart/Update this deployment
- A delete pod event is sent to notify the kubelet and the Endpoint Controller (which manages the Service endpoints) simultaneously.
- PreStop hook starts, which will delay the shutdown sequence by 5 seconds. During this time, the Endpoint Controller will remove the terminating pod, and the traffic will be sent to other running pods.
- When the timeout of 5 seconds ended, the old pod is killed, and new pods will be created. There is no traffic sent to the terminating pod during the update.

## Motivation

Currently, Kubernetes supports two types of actions for PreStop hooks: exec and httpGet. Although these actions offer flexibility, they often require additional scripting or custom solutions to achieve a simple sleep functionality. A built-in sleep action would provide a more user-friendly and native solution for scenarios where a container needs to pause before shutting down, such as:

- Ensuring that the container gracefully releases resources and connections.
- Allowing a smooth transition in load balancers or service meshes.
- Providing a buffer period for external monitoring and alerting systems.

### Goals

- Allow containers to perform cleanup or shutdown actions before being terminated, by sleeping for a specified duration in the preStop hook.
- Improve the overall reliability and availability of Kubernetes applications by providing a way for containers to gracefully terminate.

### Non-Goals

- This KEP does not aim to replace other Kubernetes features that can be used to perform cleanup actions, such as init containers or sidecar containers.
- This KEP does not aim to provide a way to pause or delay pod termination indefinitely.

## Proposal

We propose adding a new sleep action for the PreStop hook, which will pause the container for a specified duration before termination. The API changes will include the following:

- Extending the LifecycleHandler object to support a new Sleep field.
- Adding a SleepAction object that includes a Duration field to specify the sleep period in seconds.

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1
As a Kubernetes user, I want to configure my container to sleep for a specific duration during graceful termination and I want to do it without needing a sleep binary in my image.

#### Story 2
As a Kubernetes user, I want to configure my nginx service to be able to run with zero downtime.Previously,I use `command: ["/bin/sh","-c","sleep 20"]` in prestop hook with exec command to delay the shutdown,and let the Endpoint Controller remove the pod first. But this requires me to have a sleep binary in my image, and I want to do this more conveniently.

### Risks and Mitigations

N/A

## Design Details

### Implementation

- Adding a SleepAction object that includes a Duration field to specify the sleep period in seconds.
```go
type SleepAction struct {
	// Seconds is the number of seconds to sleep. 
	Seconds int32
}
```

-  Adding a Sleep field to the LifecycleHandler struct, which represents the duration in seconds that the container should sleep before being terminated during the preStop hook.
```go
type LifecycleHandler struct {
	// Sleep represents the duration in seconds that the container should sleep before being terminated. If the container terminates before the sleep finishes, this action will be interrupted.
	Sleep *SleepAction
}
```

- When Kubernetes executes the preStop hook with sleep action, it'll simply sleep for a specific seconds.
```go
func (hr *handlerRunner) Run(ctx context.Context, containerID kubecontainer.ContainerID, pod *v1.Pod, container *v1.Container, handler *v1.LifecycleHandler) (string, error) {
    switch {
    case handler.Exec != nil:...
    case handler.HTTPGet != nil:...
    case handler.Sleep != nil:
        hr.runSleepHandler(ctx, handler.Sleep.Seconds)
        return "", nil
    default:...
    }
}

func (hr *handlerRunner) runSleepHandler(ctx context.Context, seconds int32) {
    c := time.After(time.Duration(seconds) * time.Second)
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        // early termination
        // some logs
        return
    case <-c:
        // sleep expired
        // some logs
        return
    }
}
```
### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

alpha:
- Test that the runSleepHandler function sleeps for the correct duration when given a valid duration value.
- Test that the runSleepHandler function returns without error when given a valid duration value.
- Test that the validation returns an error when given an invalid duration value (e.g., a negative value).
- Test that the validation returns an error when given duration is longer than the termination graceperiod.
- Test that the runSleepHandler function returns immediately when given a duration of zero.

beta:
- Test the `switch` of the feature-gate itself.
  - Test the handler is silently dropped when a pod created with feature-gate disabled.
  - Test the handler is correctly added when a pod created with feature-gate enabled. 
  - Test the handler is silently dropped when a pod created with no handler and feature-gate enabled is updated with handler and feature-gate disabled.
  - Test the handler is correctly added when a pod created with no handler and feature-gate disabled is updated with handler and feature-gate enabled.

Currently coverages:
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/core/validation`:`2023-12-20` - `83.9`
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/lifecycle/handlers`:`2023-12-20` - `86.3` 

##### Integration tests
N/A

##### e2e tests
- Basic functionality
  1. Create a simple pod with a container that runs a long-running process.
  2. Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with a specified sleep duration (e.g., 5 seconds).
  3. Delete the pod and observe the time it takes for the container to terminate.
  4. Verify that the container sleeps for the specified duration before it is terminated.
  5. Verify that the container keeps executing code while sleeping.

- Sleep duration boundary testing
  1. Create a simple pod with a container that runs a long-running process.
  2. Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with various sleep durations, including:1 seconds (minimum allowed value), values slightly above the minimum allowed value (to test edge cases).
  3. For each sleep duration, delete the pod and observe the time it takes for the container to terminate.
  4. Verify that the container sleeps for the specified duration before it is terminated.
  5. Verify that the container keeps executing code while sleeping.

- Container exit/crash testing
  1. Create a simple pod with a container that will exit soon.
  2. Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with a specified sleep duration longer than the container's lifecycle.
  3. Exit the container and observe the time it takes for the pod to terminate.
  4. Verify that the pod be deleted successfully without waiting for the entire sleep duration.

- Interaction with termination grace period
  1. Create a simple pod with a container that runs a long-running process.
  2. Add a preStop hook to the container configuration, using the new sleepAction with a specified sleep duration (e.g., 5 seconds).
  3. Set the termination grace period to various values, including:
     - Equal to the sleep duration
     - Greater than the sleep duration
     - Greater than the sleep duration, but reduced to less than the sleep duration at runtime
  4. For each termination grace period value, delete the pod and observe the time it takes for the container to terminate.
  5. Verify that the container is terminated after the min(sleep, grace).

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Additional e2e tests are completed(if needed)

#### GA

- No negative feedback
- No bug issues reported
- [e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/94df29b8f278503c3b332280132202096e247128/test/e2e/common/node/lifecycle_hook.go#L550) are promoted to conformance

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

#### Upgrade
The previous PreStop behavior will not be broken. Users can continue to use their hooks as it is.
To use this enhancement, users need to enable the feature gate, and add sleep action in their prestop hook.

#### Downgrade
It will silently drop the sleep prestop hook if someone wants to add that to the object (or create object with it). However, existing objects that have it set will not be cleared.

### Version Skew Strategy

Both kubelet and kube-apiserver will need enable the feature gate for the full featureset
to be present. If both components disable the feature gate, this feature will be cleanly unavailable.

If only the kube-apiserver enable this feature, validation will pass, but kubelet won't understand the new field and will ignore it when pod is terminating.

If only the kubelet enable this feature, when creating/updating a resource with the sleepAction, this field will be silently dropped.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: PodLifecycleSleepAction
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kubelet,kube-apiserver

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

The feature can be disabled in Alpha and Beta versions by restarting kube-apiserver with the feature-gate off. In terms of Stable versions, users can choose to opt-out by not setting the sleep field.

In this case, the created pods's sleepAction will take effect, and the new pod with sleepAction is not allowed to create.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

New pods with sleep action in prestop hook can be created.
Previously created pod with sleep hook set will execute it before terminating.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?
For alpha, the `switch` of feature gate is tested manually.
For beta, unit tests for the `switch` of feature gate itself will be added in `pkg/registry/core/pod/strategy_test`.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

The change is opt-in, it doesn't impact already running workloads. 

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

Users have to check Metric `sleep_action_terminated_early_total`.
If it increases unreasonably, then user should check if something goes wrong and may need a rollback.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

This is an opt-in feature, and it does not change any default behavior. We manually tested enabling and disabling this feature by changing kubelet and kube-api-server config and restarting them.

The manual test steps are as following:

1. Create a local 1.29 k8s cluster, and create a test-pod in that cluster.
2. Enable PodLifecycleSleepAction feature in kubelet and kube-api-server and restart both. 
3. Add a prestop hook with sleep action to the test-pod and delete it, observe the time cost.
4. Create another pod with sleep action.
5. Disable PodLifecycleSleepAction feature in kubelet and kube-api-server and restart both.  
6. Delete the pod created in step 4, and observe the time cost.
###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

Inspect the prestop hook configuration

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Check the logs of the container during termination, check the termination duration.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

N/A

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

- [x] Metrics
  - Metric name:
    - sleep_action_terminated_early_total(counts the number of Pods got terminated before sleep action finishes)
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Check the logs of the container during termination, check the termination duration.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

N/A

### Dependencies

N/A

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

LifecycleHandler objects have one new fields per version they define, increasing their size slightly.
See `Implementation` part

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?
- In general, if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable, Kubernetes will be unable to coordinate container termination and the preStop hook may not be executed at all. This could result in the container being terminated abruptly without the opportunity to perform any necessary cleanup actions.

- If the sleep action is enabled for the preStop hook, it will still attempt to sleep for the specified duration before the container is terminated. However, if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable, Kubernetes may be unable to send the SIGTERM signal to the container, which could cause the container to continue running beyond the specified sleep period.

###### What are other known failure modes?

N/A

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

Disable PodLifecycleSleepAction feature gate, and restart related components.

## Implementation History

- 2023-04-22: Initial draft KEP
- 2023-12-20: Target to beta in v1.30 
- 2024-09-21: Target to stable in v1.32
  
## Drawbacks

N/A

## Alternatives

Another way to run `sleep` in a container is to use `exec` command in `preStop hook` like `command: ["/bin/sh","-c","sleep 20"]`. However, this requires a sleep binary in the image. We should offer sleep as a first-class thing.
